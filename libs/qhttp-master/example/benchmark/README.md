# benchmark

a utility to load testing of `QHttp` by simulating a *RESTful/Json* server and attacking clients. both TCP and unix (local) sockets are implemented.

> for Json parser and builder, see [azadkuh/gason++](https://github.com/azadkuh/gason--)



## usage
to see the options:
```bash
$> ./benchmark -h
```

Options:
  -h, --help               Displays this help.
  -v, --version            Displays version information.
  -b, --backend <type>     backend type of http connection. could be tcp or
                           local (unix socket). default: tcp
  -t, --timeout <number>   maximum timeout for an open connection. default:
                           5000
  -p, --port <portNumber>  server's tcp port number. default: 8080
  -a, --address <ip>       server's address (url or ip[:port]), only in client
                           mode. default: localhost
  -c, --count <number>     number of sockets to be connected to the server,
                           only in client mode. default: 10
  -T, --threads <number>   number of worker threads (thread-pool) in server or
                           client mode. default: 1

Arguments:
  mode                     working mode, client or server. default: server
```


some notes:

* **`timeout`**: in mili seconds.
    * server mode:
    an HTTP connection shall be automatically closed if this timeout value has elapsed. It's useful when the other side of connection is not responding.
you can pass `0` (zero) to disable the timeout.
    
    * client mode:
    the time interval between requests. e.g. 10 means send HTTP request every 10 [mSec] to the server. range: [1, 10000]

* **`count`**:
the number of concurrent HTTP connections.
As `Qt` and therefor `QHttp` are asynchronous, this app uses a single `thread` to open the all concurrent connections.

* **`threads`**:
the number of working threads (worker threads are persistence as in a thread-pool).

## execution
to start a Json server:
```bash
$> ./benchmark server -p 8080 -t 0
# -t 0 : disables timeout on incoming connections.
```

to setup attacking client(s):
```bash
$> benchmark client --count 100 --timeout 50 --port 8080
# so in theory 100 * (1000 / 50) = 2,000 requests are made per second
```


## data transfer
attacking clients send `POST` requests with a `json` body as:
```json
{
  "clientId": 35,
  "requestId": 23445656,
  "command": "request"
}
```

the server checks the incoming `json` and increment `requestId` value, then responds as:
```json
{
  "clientId": 35,
  "requestId": 23445657,
  "command": "response"
}
```

finally the client checks the server's response body as `json`, and after `timeout` value, it will send the next request. 


## results
the server prints the performance results as:
>DateTime, AveTps, miliSecond, Count, TotalCount

approximately in each 10,000 mili seconds:

...
```

where:

* **`DateTime`**: ticking date & time.

* **`AveTps`**: average TPS (transaction per second) in the last interval. Each transaction (connection) contains a request and the corresponding response.

* **`miliSecond`**: time elapsed in the last interval.

* **`Count`**: amount of transactions in the last interval.

* **`TotalCount`**: total transactions which have been successfully replied so far.

## unix sockets
if you wan't to run benchmark on Unix (local) sockets instead of TCP socket, simply use:
```bash
$> ./benchmark server -b local -t 0 --threads 4
```
as server and:
```bash
$> benchmark client --count 100 --timeout 10 -b local
```
for attacking clients.

by using Unix socket the application reaches to the higher `AveTps` by avoiding TCP overheads.
